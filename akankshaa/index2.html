    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (abbreviated to CSS ), style sheets, are a possibility to separate the design of web pages from their actual content and to record them centrally. The English "style" means "layout", not writing style. The term "cascading" (like a waterfall) refers to the possibility of inheriting formatting properties.

        The CSS information for the design of the document is appended to its HTML code. This information may be in the HTML file itself, but also in a separate file to which the HTML document refers. Such an external file is also called a style sheet .
        
        A major reason for the introduction of Cascading Style Sheets was the simpler and more consistent design of web pages, with fewer web browser- specific quirks. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has set the standard for this. The established standard has expanded considerably over the years. The original standard is known as CSS1 . Later extensions are known as CSS2 and CSS3 . This latest extension (CSS3) is partly still under development and as such is not an official standard.</p>
